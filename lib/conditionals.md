# What is a conditional?

Conditionals allow us to take an input and then return different outputs depending on certain criteria.
- 'if'/'elsif'/'else' statements can be used to test different sets of conditions.
- 'if' can also be tagged onto a line of code with a condition. The code will execute if the condition is met.
- 'unless' can also be tagged onto a line of code with a condition. The code will execute unless the condition is met(opposite of "if")
- 'case'/'when'/'else' statements can be used to test a large amount of conditions. It could be used in a situation where we needed a       different output depending on the current month like in a Zeller's Congruence case.
- 'while' loops allow us to run expressions while a certain condition is met.
- 'until' loops allow us to run expressions until a certain condiction is met.

# What is the difference between `=` and `==`?

'=' is used to set variables equal to strings, integers, floats, and booleans.
'==' is used when we went to compare two items in a conditional.
